Firstly, boil the potatoes.
Mash the boiled potatoes in a resealable bag using a rolling pin after boiling them.
Finely chop the spring onions and add them to the mashed potatoes.
After adding salt and black pepper, mix everything thoroughly.
Take a spoonful of the potato mixture, place diced cheddar cheese inside, shape it into a ball, then coat it in flour, egg, and breadcrumbs.
Heat a frying pan with plenty of vegetable oil. While the oil is heating up, beat the egg in a separate bowl.
Coat the potato balls first with flour, then dip them in the beaten egg, and finally coat them with breadcrumbs.
Carefully place the coated potato balls into the hot oil and fry, turning them to ensure they are evenly browned on all sides.
