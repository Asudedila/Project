Remove the stems from the mushrooms and sprinkle a little salt inside each mushroom. You can peel the mushroom caps if desired.
Bake the mushrooms on a tray at 170 degrees Celsius for 20 minutes without adding water or oil. Utilize or discard any released moisture. Verify doneness with a toothpick.
For the minced meat filling, chop the onions and sauté them in a bit of oil. Once the onions turn slightly golden, add the diced pointed peppers and continue sautéing.
Then add the minced meat and cook until it changes color.
After the meat changes color, add the peeled and diced tomato, salt, and spices.
Once the sautéing is done, fill the mushrooms with the prepared mixture.
Sprinkle grated cheddar cheese on top of the filled mushrooms.
For the sauce, mix the tomato paste with a little water and pour it over the mushrooms.
Place the tray back in the oven at 170°C and bake for another 10 minutes or until the cheese melts and gets golden brown.
