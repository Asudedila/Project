Falafel
2 cups chickpeas,1 onion,2 cloves of garlic,1 egg,1 cup flour,1 teaspoon baking soda,Half a bunch of parsley,1 teaspoon black pepper,1 teaspoon salt,4 tablespoons strained yogurt,2 tablespoons tahini,1 tablespoon lemon juice
Place boiled chickpeas, onion, garlic, and parsley in a food processor. Pulse until all the ingredients are combined.
Transfer the chickpea mixture to a suitable bowl. Add flour, egg, black pepper, ground coriander, and salt. Mix well using a spoon.
Cover the mixture with plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for about an hour.
After the resting period, take portions of the mixture and roll them into walnut-sized balls.
Place the shaped falafel mixture on a tray lined with plastic wrap.
Repeat the process until all the mixture is used. 
If you want to store the falafels in the freezer, you can let them freeze for a few hours, then place them in a ziplock bag.
This way, you can take out as many as needed for cooking at any time.
For the sauce, mix strained yogurt, tahini, lemon juice, and salt in a bowl until well combined.
When ready to fry, heat oil in a pan. Fry the falafels until they are nicely browned on the outside. 
Then, using a slotted spoon, transfer them onto a plate lined with paper towels to drain the excess oil.
