YOGURT,FLOUR,EGG,OIL
Yogurt Soup
1 cup yogurt,2 tablespoons flour,1 egg yolk,1 tablespoon oil
Start by toasting the flour in butter or oil over low heat until it develops a slight aroma.
Add chicken broth or water to the toasted flour, stir, and bring it to a boil.
In a separate bowl, mix yogurt with the egg yolk, whisking well.
Take a ladle of the boiling soup and slowly add it to the yogurt mixture, stirring continuously (this helps prevent the yogurt from curdling when added to the hot soup).
Pour the yogurt mixture back into the soup pot, stirring well, and let it come to a boil again.
Add salt to taste and simmer for a few more minutes.
Optionally, garnish with mint before serving.
