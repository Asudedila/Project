Stuffed Peppers
500g green bell peppers for stuffing,1 tablespoon rice per pepper,1 onion,1 tablespoon tomato paste,Parsley,2-3 tomatoes,Black pepper,Salt,Mint,Oil
Clean the bell peppers by removing their seeds and cores.
Finely chop the onions and tomatoes. We'll use the edges of the tomatoes to cover the tops of the peppers, so it's better to cut them beforehand for covering purposes.
You can use the inside of the tomatoes in the stuffing.
In a bowl, mix the prepared onions, rice, tomato paste, parsley, tomatoes, black pepper, salt, mint, and a small amount of vegetable oil thoroughly.
Stuff the peppers with this mixture.
Arrange the stuffed peppers in a pot.
Pour hot water into the bowl where you prepared the stuffing. 
Approximately halfway up the peppers in the pot, add a tablespoon of tomato paste to the water and dissolve it.
Pour this mixture into the pot, covering the peppers halfway.
Use the cut tomatoes to cover the tops of the peppers.
Drizzle a small amount of vegetable oil or olive oil over the peppers.
Cook the dish over low heat until the peppers are tender.
