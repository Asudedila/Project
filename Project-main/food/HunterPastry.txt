First, prepare the filling by sautéing the minced meat with a bit of vegetable oil until it slightly changes color. Then add the finely chopped onions and continue sautéing. You can add a bit more oil if needed.
Meanwhile, soak the fine bulgur in hot water.
Once the minced meat and onions are cooked, add the soaked bulgur, ground walnuts, salt, and spices. Stir for 1-2 minutes and then turn off the heat. 
Mix water and vegetable oil in a bowl.
Lay out one sheet of phyllo dough and brush it thoroughly with the water-oil mixture.
Place the second sheet of phyllo dough on top and brush it with the mixture again. Divide it into 8 equal pieces.
Place the minced meat filling along the longer edges and fold the sides over, rolling it not too tightly nor too loosely.
Repeat the same process with the other two phyllo sheets.
Whisk an egg into the remaining water-oil mixture.
Dip each pastry in the liquid mixture and then coat it with breadcrumbs. Arrange them on a baking tray.
Bake in a preheated oven at 200 degrees Celsius until they turn golden brown.
