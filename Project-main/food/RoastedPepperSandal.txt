Wash the red peppers and roast them in an oven at 200 degrees Celsius until charred, remembering to turn them occasionally.

Cube the remaining vegetables and fry them in vegetable oil. Transfer the fried vegetables to a bowl.
For the sauce, cook the chopped tomato and garlic in a small pan with vegetable oil until the tomato releases its juices.
Add the tomato paste, cooking for an additional 1-2 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper, then turn off the heat.
Pour this sauce over the fried vegetables and mix well.
Distribute the sauced vegetables evenly into the roasted pepper "boats." Finally, sprinkle chopped parsley on top before serving.
