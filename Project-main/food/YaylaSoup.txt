YOGURT,FLOUR,EGG,RICE
Yayla Soup
1 cup yogurt,3 tablespoons flour,1 egg yolk,6 cups water or chicken broth,2 tablespoons rice (optional)
Roast the flour over low heat until it develops a slight aroma.
In a bowl, combine yogurt and egg yolk, whisking well.
Add the roasted flour to the yogurt mixture and mix thoroughly.
In a separate pot, bring water or chicken broth to a boil.
Slowly add the boiling liquid to the yogurt mixture, stirring continuously to prevent curdling.
Transfer the mixture back to the pot and bring it to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly.
Add salt and, if desired, rice. Continue boiling until the rice is cooked.
Reduce the heat and simmer for a few more minutes, stirring occasionally.
Optionally, garnish with mint before serving.
